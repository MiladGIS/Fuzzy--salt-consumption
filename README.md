# Salt Consumption Calculator with Mamdani Fuzzy Inference System

This practice is a Python program that calculates salt consumption using the Mamdani Fuzzy Inference System. The calculation is based on the user's age and blood pressure (both Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP) and Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP)).

## Description

The application takes the user's age, DBP, and SBP as inputs, and uses a Mamdani Fuzzy Inference System to calculate the estimated salt consumption in milligrams (mg). The ipynb file contains more optimized and concise code than main.py.
